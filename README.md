####B: Nordic Market Simulation
####The day-ahead electricity spot market, Elspot, is the main platform to trade electricity in the Nordic region. Here, electricity suppliers and buyers place their bids a day in advance for delivery of electricity during the next day. In this exercise, you will simulate such a market, but with a few simplifications and assumptions as follows:
You will use a single-auction bidding strategy and simulate for only one hour.
Generators are assumed to bid their actual marginal costs.
There is a tie-line connecting Sweden and Poland that is assumed to behave as a load (on Sweden side) of 600MW.
Estonia is not a participant in this market.
